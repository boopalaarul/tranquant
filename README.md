I would like to use Python to implement a tool similar to RSEM, which can take in a set of RNA-seq reads aligned to a transcriptome and output a table of genes (labeled by gene ID) with all transcripts found in the dataset (labeled by transcript ID) followed by gene expression metrics like R/FPKM and TPM.
